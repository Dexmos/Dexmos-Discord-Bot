# DiscordBot

Discord bot I use for my own server.

## Features

* League of Legend API to show current player rankings.
* Show memes (from URL stocked in JSON).
* Soundbox (join voice channel, play sounds with commands, stay or leave channel). **Note : May change into voice command to trigger sounds in the future**
* Basics interactions (reacts/replies to messages/mentions, help command...).

## Other

Contain private jokes from server but **code is working**.
